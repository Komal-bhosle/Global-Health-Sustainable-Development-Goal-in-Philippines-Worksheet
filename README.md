Clean Water and Sanitation in Philippines
Access to clean water and sanitation has been a major global health concern, and the Philippines is the country where this problem has been there since long time. Although there has been progress, there are many rural and urban communities that lack drinking water and sanitation. There have been specific reasons such as increasing population, poverty, and natural disasters have been worsening the problem by contaminating water. This polluted water harbors insects and mosquitoes which contribute to increasing waterborne diseases causing diarrhea, cholera and typhoid affecting children. International organizations, the Philippines government and local NGOs have been working together to improve water system, sanitation facilities and hygiene education ensuring safe water and sanitation is provided for the population and reducing diseases in the country.
Philippines identified as Middle-income Country as classified by World Bank, with significant economic growth  but has poverty in many regions. There is a division of rural and urban areas, where urban areas have better infrastructure while rural areas lack safe water. Philippines often has typhoons, floods and earthquake which disrupt water supply and sanitation facilities. (Sustainable Development Goal 6: Clean Water and Sanitation | United Nations in Philippines, n.d.)
The case is focusing on Philippines and its clean water, and sanitation challenges, directly relates to Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6): “Ensure availability and sustainable management of waste and sanitation for all”. (United Nations, 2015) This aims to provide universal access to safe and affordable drinking water, sanitation and hygiene for everyone. (United Nations, 2015)  
Target 6.1: “Achieve universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all”.
Target 6.2: “Achieve access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene, and end open defecation, paying special attention to women, girls and vulnerable populations”.
Target 6.3: “Improve water quality by reducing pollution and minimizing the release of hazardous materials”.
Target 6.b: “Support and strengthen the participation of local communities in improving water and sanitation management”. (United Nations, 2015)
Poor access to clean water and sanitation also impacts SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being), as contaminated water leads to preventable diseases. Addressing water and sanitation problems in Philippines is essential to manage even the other interconnected goals.
Population affected
The group of people most affected by poor access to clean water and sanitation in Philippines are children under the age of 5 years are most at risk of diarrhea and malnutrition which can be caused due to unsafe water. Rural population where water supply infrastructure is limited and is often disrupted due to frequent natural disasters. Urban population is also affected due to problems caused by inadequate waste disposal and contamination of water. Women and girls, face problems due to hygiene challenges during menstruation and are more exposed to risks in areas without proper sanitation.
Stakeholders involved
The Government of Philippines in the form of Department of Health (DOH) and Local Water Utilities Administration (LWUA) develop policies, water supply system and sanitation programs. International Organizations such as WHO, UNICEF, and World Bank support water, sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) and fund in the improvement of infrastructure. (United Nations, 2015)  NGOs such as Water.org and local NGOs create and implement community  level water projects and hygiene promotion. Private sector and local communities  help in building water systems and promoting hygiene education. (United Nations, 2015)
Challenges faced in addressing clean water and Sanitation
Many rural and remote communities lack piped water systems and safe sanitation facilities. Frequent typhoons, flooding and earthquakes damage water supply system, contaminate ground water, making access to clean water unpredictable. Another major challenge is that these programs are often underfunded and national and local agencies slow progress. 
USAID in partnership with the Government of Philippines, and local governments, covering provinces with five-year initiative aiming over 1.1 million people with more than 35,000 individuals getting access to safe drinking water and sanitation. This partnership supports SDG 6.1 by increasing access to safe water and SDG 6.2 by expanding sanitation. UNICEF and Action Against Hunger Philippines is implementing strategies to strengthen local WASH program and DRR(Disaster Risk Reduction), improving technical capacity, hygiene promotion, water source management and sanitation services. This enhances SDG 6.1/6.2 through WASH service delivery. 
Traditional hygiene practices such as open defecation or usage of untreated wells are long-standing, behavior change programs need gradually to introduce alternatives. Collecting water is often seen as women’s responsibility, steps need to be taken to consider gender roles and ensure solutions that reduce burden on women and girls. Poverty and inequality often cause conditions where people lack resources. Political issues such as water and sanitation are divided among national and local governments resulting in fragmented planning and slow implementation. Political inefficiencies and corruption can delay water infrastructure projects or affect their quality.
As a future public health professional, I would focus on lack of community engagement and awareness about safe water and sanitation practices. I would adopt a community-based participatory approach that involves local leaders, schools and women’s groups from the planning stage. This could include Health Education campaigns, Training community health workers and volunteers. By improving knowledge, skills and community participation, these actions would help change long standing practices like open defecation and increase proper use of safe water facilities.  This would align with public health improvement and support SDG 6.2 and SDG 6.3.
